New and improved Tic Tac Toe in shell! Coded using object-oriented approach


* Includes a bot trained via reinforcement learning which is unbeatable.
* Can play vs the bot either in 1st or 2nd position
* Can play a human vs human game
* Can run without python installed, just run the exe in the folder you downloaded!

You can also simulate games of ai vs ai, either random games or with a trained bot.
If you like, you could train the bot yourself again using already made functions in 'main.py', but you'll need to have python installed and play around with it abit yourself.

*TODO: Add graphics & a menu.
